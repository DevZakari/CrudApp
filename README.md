In the project, a DbContext class named DataContext was crafted, inheriting from DbContext to serve as the representation of the database context. To model the Etudiants table, a DbSet<Etudiant> property was expressly included within this DbContext class.

For the orchestration of database migrations, the power of Entity Framework Core Migrations was harnessed. The pivotal commands executed for this purpose were:

.  dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate
.  dotnet ef database update

To expedite the development of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, Visual Studio's solution explorer proved instrumental. The process was initiated by navigating to "Add" -> "New Scaffolded Item" -> "Razor Page (CRUD)." Subsequently, the Etudiant model was selected to serve as the basis for the scaffolded Razor Pages. This seamless integration in the solution explorer facilitated the efficient generation of CRUD pages for the Etudiant entity.
